What more can I say? The S9 backed by DeX is ready for prime - time. You might from my other articles know "why"
I chose to get off Windows 10. 

DeX just works. Word, Excel, Note, when you need them. And if you are all pro and need the advanced stuff 
you can setup a Amazon Workspace account or keep that laptop around. But, for me 10 out of 8 hours a day I am fine with 
DeX. I do admit there will be times when image editor GIMP will be missed. The day will come for that. Adobe is hard at 
work on their Android Photoshop stuff. I might even take a glance. For web development I do need to image tinker.
