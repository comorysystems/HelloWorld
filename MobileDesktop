The last straw. My cable connection went down. So I cut over to verizon to finish my work. I left my windows machine connected and it decided to download 
a massive update to Windows10 of features I could give a shit about. But in the process it overloaded my bandwidth at verizon. By the time I awoke to the 3rd text message 
from verizon telling me I had no more bandwidth it was too late and windows was still downloading at my new maximum rate. 

I am over it. Yes, my mistake for accidentially enabling windows update. But that is the end of that. No more windows client machines for me.
Fortuneately the S9 is out and I already did some tests and it looks like I am pushing the switch to immediately.

Dumping Windows Desktop (Keeping Server) with MHL/OTG test scheduled this week
S3 and above Testing Date: 2018-05-18 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JLFT15O/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">S3 and Up MHL/OTG</a>
S9 (USB TypeC) Testing Date: Unscheduled yet <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079249L7Z/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"> MHL/OTG</a>
Results (5/17)
The Note S3 worked. Big problem was screen resolution. The project wasn't to test rooting old phones for screen resolution fixes so I have 
to say it wasn't what I was looking for in a mobile desktop solution.
The S6 does not support MHL (just FYI).
Samsung sells a product called DEX for S9 that turns the phone into the mouse, allows screen resolution to be set, and has keyboard. 
For 100.00. Someone already into the S9 would be wise to pick that up but I will move forward with the above product linked when 
the S9 arrives.
My J series was incompatible with both as expected.
So really, until you get an S8 level device it just isn't worth doing.

(BACKSTORY)
Getting rid of the laptop / desktop once and for all! 
I am so tired of windows using my computer more I do! Without an SSD based laptop and maybe slightly older I hear my laptop
all day and all night. No development lab anymore so I get to wake up in the middle of the night to it. Before I adjusted the time 
everything went into gear it conflicted with my working hours making my computer unuseable at the very moment I wanted to work. 
Being just tired of fighting the OS for CPU time, and ignoring update after update, constant anti-virus scans which if there was
a virus it would not find it anyway, I have decided to actually commit time to this annoyance once and for all.
What is left in windows that I actually use anyway? 
1. Visual Studio. I code on servers so I really do not need a local copy. 
2. Word, Excel. There are cloud/online solutions. Besides, word has become so bulky simple functions are rediculous, I am not a fan.
Excel is useful but I am not an accountant so I am not sure I need a local copy anymore.
3. GIMP and Unity3d - This can also be installed server side. Not sure that it would be the perfect graphic studio but will see.
4. Remote Desktop - There are non-window versions that appear to work fine. 
So at least for me there is not much use anymore for the bulky OS. Windows IoT was dumb, you get updates and Zero OS and it crashed on 
the PI3, it might work on higher end SBC's but who wants to buy a higher end SBC as a computer? Why not just use the phone, then you could
at least take your work on the road. 
Turns out, I was behind the curve again about 5 years. Android seems to have been able to support HDMI, keyboard, mouse for quite some time
but we shall see if that is true. It is not until the S9 where there is any claim to that - that I could find, but there are cables / hubs
that are supposed to work as far back as S3? I will try and S4. But first, can we print on an Android? Not that I print a lot but there is 
that one time a year when somebody still is stuck in the dark ages and needs hard copy.

Ok so there will be some kind of printing from Android. I considered other OS eg: making my own phone and running Ubuntu or whatever, 
even ChromiumOS. I found verizons developer site that lists tons of microcontrollers, it would be easy but it seems like one would be 
swimming up stream. So Android and a standard phone from Samsung. Dan brought over a broken S4 I will try that. Just for fun. The 
phone itself works but has no video. If I can bring a broken S4 to life then it is just a matter of horsepower to do what I wanna do.

The first one is for pre-S9 and the second is S9 (covering the USB-TypeC).
If you want to do your own search, I suggest MHL + OTG, MHL gives you video and OTG gives you USB (old school) for mouse and keyboard. 
If you want to burn the Bluetooth you can go that route for keyboard/mouse but if it works all-in-one style I would hold on to 
old school usb and save the bluetooth for something else. Credit Card processing can use USB or bluetooth depending, and audo likes bluetooth
although you will likely get audio from your HDMI it is not a bad idea to have another route just in case. Headsets also like bluetooth.

I will commit an update when I get done testing the S4 later today. Note: I know OTG works going into this but it is the HDMI plus
OTG that I wonder about. If this has been functional for years and I am just now figuring it out I will be embarassed yet I will 
get over that in the joy it will bring to dump windows. I used to be a huge fan of windows. As a Server OS I think I still am. I never 
see CPU issues on the server and since I do not sleep next to my servers if the hard drive is spinning it does not wake me up. But, 
for client-side, I am just not using whatever it is they are giving me every day that is worth all the tug of war. And, the added 
benefit of putting my laptop in my pocket seems pretty cool. I never liked the keyboard and mouse on laptops anyway. I will be able 
to use standard mobile, or switch into OTG mode, and maybe even get a mobile monitor. In any event, one device for all my needs. 
Woot!
